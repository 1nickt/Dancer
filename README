Dancer

This is a pet-project (one more) that inted to become a port 
of Ruby's Sinatra framework: a framework with minimal-effort 
in mind.

The user should be able to define a webapp with very few line of codes.

See http://www.sinatrarb.com for details of the concept.

Feel free to fork that project if you like the idea and want to add some
features.
