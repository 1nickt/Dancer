* Get rid of redefine warnings about 'pass'

    Running the test suite triggers this warning: 
    `Subroutine main::pass redefined at ...'

* Write a test suite for action passing

    The action skipping mechanism works but is not tested.

* Conditions support for route matching: 

    get '/foo', {agent => 'Songbird (\d\.\d)[\d\/]*?'} => sub {
        ...
    };

* Template rendering support

    get '/' => sub {
        ...
        render index => $stuff;
    };
 
 render should then use a template system for rendering the view 
 located in $views_directory/index.tpl with $stuff data
