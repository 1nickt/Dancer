# {{ page.title }}

So, this is the first post of this blog.

This blog is the Official Perl Dancer Blog. It's the official mean of
communication for __official Dancer developers__.

You'll find on this blog official announcements about new versions, stable and
unstable updates, security updates, etc.

This may also be a place for information about design decisions, upcoming
technology inclusions, and major changes in the project.

Technical matters will probably be the main subjects, but news about the crew
(like new official developers announcements) and the project at large may
occur.

Stay tuned for more content.
